	<h3>The Boy Who Lived</h3>

	<img class="chapter-logo" src="img/hp_chapter_one.jpg" alt="Картинка героя младенца">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;and Mrs Dursley, of&nbsp;number four, Privet Drive, were proud to&nbsp;say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you&rsquo;d expect to&nbsp;be&nbsp;involved in&nbsp;anything <strong>strange</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>mysterious</strong>, because they just didn&rsquo;t hold with such nonsense.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Dursley was the director of&nbsp;a&nbsp;firm called <b><i>Grunnings</i></b>, which made drills. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he&nbsp;did have a&nbsp;very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of&nbsp;neck, which came in&nbsp;very useful as&nbsp;she spent so&nbsp;much of&nbsp;her time craning over garden fences, spying on&nbsp;the neighbours. The Dursleys had a&nbsp;small son called Dudley and in&nbsp;their opinion there was no&nbsp;finer boy anywhere.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a&nbsp;secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover&nbsp;it. They didn&rsquo;t think they could bear it&nbsp;if&nbsp;anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley&rsquo;s sister, but they hadn&rsquo;t met for several years; in&nbsp;fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn&rsquo;t have a&nbsp;sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as<s>&nbsp;unDursleyish</s> as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was possible to&nbsp;be. The Dursleys shuddered to&nbsp;think what the neighbours would say if&nbsp;the Potters arrived in&nbsp;the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a&nbsp;small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn&rsquo;t want Dudley mixing with a&nbsp;child like that.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr&nbsp;and Mrs Dursley woke up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to&nbsp;suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be&nbsp;happening all over the country. Mr&nbsp;Dursley hummed as&nbsp;he&nbsp;picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as&nbsp;she wrestled a&nbsp;screaming Dudley into his high chair.</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of&nbsp;them noticed a&nbsp;large tawny owl flutter past the window.
	At&nbsp;half past eight, Mr&nbsp;Dursley picked up&nbsp;his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on&nbsp;the cheek and tried to&nbsp;kiss Dudley goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a&nbsp;tantrum and throwing his cereal at&nbsp;the walls. <i>&lsquo;Little tyke,&rsquo;</i> chortled Mr&nbsp;Dursley as&nbsp;he&nbsp;left the house. He&nbsp;got into his car and backed out of&nbsp;number four&rsquo;s drive.</p>

	<h3>The Vanishing Glass</h3>

	<p>Nearly ten years hassed since the Dursleys had woken up&nbsp;to&nbsp;find their nephew on&nbsp;the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at&nbsp;The sun rose on&nbsp;the same tidy front gardens and lit up&nbsp;the brass number four on&nbsp;the Dursleys&rsquo; front door; it&nbsp;crept into their living-room, which was almost exactly the same as&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been on&nbsp;the night when Mr&nbsp;Dursley had seen that fatefews report about the owls. Only the photographs on&nbsp;the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of&nbsp;pictures of&nbsp;what looked like a&nbsp;large pink beach ball wearing different-coloured bobble hats&nbsp;&mdash; but Dudley Dursley was no&nbsp;longer a&nbsp;baby, and now the photographs showed a&nbsp;large, blond boy riding his first bicycle, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;roundabout at&nbsp;the fair, playing a&nbsp;computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by&nbsp;his mother. The room held no&nbsp;sign at&nbsp;all that another boy lived in&nbsp;the house, too.Nearly ten years hassed since the Dursleys had woken up&nbsp;to&nbsp;find their nephew on&nbsp;the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at&nbsp;The sun rose on&nbsp;the same tidy front gardens and lit up&nbsp;the brass number four on&nbsp;the Dursleys&rsquo; front door; it&nbsp;crept into their living-room, which was almost exactly the same as&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been on&nbsp;the night when Mr&nbsp;Dursley had seen that fatefews report about the owls.

	<p>Yet Harry Potter was &gt;still there, asleep at&nbsp;the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it&nbsp;was her shrill voice which made the first noise of&nbsp;the day.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>Up! Get up! Now!</i>&rsquo;
	Harry woke with a&nbsp;start. His aunt rapped on&nbsp;the door aul ngain.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>Up!</i>&rsquo; she screeched. Harry heard her walking towards the kitchen and then the sound of&nbsp;the frying pan being put on&nbsp;the cooker. He&nbsp;rolled on&nbsp;to&nbsp;his back and tried to&nbsp;remember the dream he&nbsp;had been having. It&nbsp;had been a&nbsp;good one. There had been a&nbsp;flying motorbike in&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;funny feeling he&rsquo;d had the same dream before.
	His aunt was back outside the door.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>Are you up&nbsp;yet?&rsquo;</i> she demanded.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>Nearly,</i>&rsquo; said Harry.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>Well, get a&nbsp;move&nbsp;on, I&nbsp;want you to&nbsp;look after the bacon. And don&rsquo;t you dare let it&nbsp;burn, I&nbsp;want everything perfect on&nbsp;Duddy&rsquo;s birthday.</i>&rsquo;Harry groaned.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>What did you say?</i>&rsquo; his aunt snapped through the door.<br>
	&lsquo;<i>Nothing, nothing ...</i>&rsquo;</p>

	<h3>The Letters from No One</h3>

	<p>The escape of&nbsp;the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;was allowed out of&nbsp;his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new cine-camera, crashed his remote-control aeroplane and, first time on&nbsp;his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as&nbsp;she crossed Privet Drive on&nbsp;her crutches.</p>

	<p>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no&nbsp;escaping Dudley&rsquo;s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as&nbsp;Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of&nbsp;the lot, he&nbsp;was the leader. The rest of&nbsp;them were all quite happy to&nbsp;join in&nbsp;Dudley&rsquo;s favourite sport: Harry-hunting.</p>
